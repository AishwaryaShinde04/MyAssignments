    "Python Assignment OOps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans=The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, in simple terms, is to organize and structure code by representing real-world objects and their interactions. OOP helps create reusable and modular code, making it easier to develop and maintain complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is a class in Python?\n",
    "Ans= a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that have certain attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods). It serves as a template or a prototype that defines the structure and behavior of objects of a specific type\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "Ans=Attributes store information about the object's current state. For example, if you have a class called \"Car,\" some possible attributes could be \"color,\" \"brand,\" \"model,\" and \"current_speed.\" Each instance of the Car class (i.e., each car object) will have its own set of attribute values.Attributes can have different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, or even other objects.\n",
    "methods=These are functions defined within a class that define the behavior of the objects. Methods represent the actions or operations that objects can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "Ans=Class Variables:\n",
    "Class variables are shared among all instances of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods.\n",
    "Class variables are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Variables:\n",
    "Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within the instance methods or the constructor of a class.\n",
    "Each instance of a class can have different values for its instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "Ans=The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n"
